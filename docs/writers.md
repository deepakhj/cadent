# Writers

Accumulators can "write" to something other then a tcp/udp/http/socket, to say things like a FILE, MySQL DB or cassandra.
(since this is Golang all writer types need to have their own driver embed in).  If you only want accumulators to write out to
these things, you can specify the `backend` to `BLACKHOLE` which will NOT try to reinsert the line back into the pipeline
and the line "ends" with the Accumulator stage.

    InLine(port 8126) -> Splitter -> [Accumulator] -> WriterBackend

Writers should hold more then just the "aggregated data point" but a few useful things like

    Min, Max, Sum, Last and Count

because who's to say what you really want from aggregated values.
`Count` is just actually how many data points arrived in the aggregation window (for those wanting `Mean` = (Sum / Count))

Writers themselves are split into 2 sections "Indexers" and "Metrics"

Indexers: take a metrics "name" which has the form

    Tag{
        Name string
        Value string
    }

    StatName{
        Key string
        UniqueId uint64
        UniqueIdString string
        Tags  []Tag
        MetaTags []Tag
        Resolution uint32
        TTL uint32
    }

And will "index it" somehow.  Currently the "tags" are not yet used in the indexers .. but the future ....

The StatName has a "UniqueID" which is basically a FNV64a hash of the following

    FNV64a(Key + ":" + sortByName(Tags))

Tags therefore will be part of the unique identifier of things.  Several formats may include a "key + tags" or just "tags".
This can cause a little confusion as to what the unique ID is.  For instance in a graphite standard, the key is
 `pth.to.my.metric`.  In the [metrics2.0](https://github.com/metrics20/spec) spec there is no "key" so
 the acctuall key is derived inside cadent as `name1=value1.name2=value2...` but the unique ID would then be

    FNV64a("name1_is_value1.name2_is_value2..." + ":" + "name1=value1 name2=value2 ..")

So it's a bit of doubling up on the key + tags set, but for systems that do both a "key" and tags then
this method provides some resolution for differeing writer backend systems.

MetaTags are no concidered part of the unique metric, as they are subject to change.  An example of a MetaTag is the
sender of the metrics (statsd, cadent, diamond, collectd, etc).  Where the metric itself is the same, but the sender
has changed.

It should be noted that any cross MetaTag relations will therefore not be strictly unique.  For example if you change
from diamond to collectd, the metric will effectvely be tagged with both.

Metrics: The base "unit" of a metric is this

    StatMetric{
        Time int64
        Min float64
        Max float64
        Last float64
        Sum float64
        Count int64
    }


Internally these are stored as various "TimeSeries" which is explained in [the timeseries doc](./timeseries.md)
, but basically some list of the basic unit of `StatMetric`.

When writing "metrics" the StatName is important for the resolution and TTL as well as its UniqueID.

A "total" metric has the form

    TotalMetric{
         Name Statname
         Metric StatMetric
    }

## You check the injected schemas

Cadent injects the "basic" scheams for MySQL, ElasticSearch, and Cassandra.

But as a long time ops person, not every schema is geared towards use cases. So please check them to make sure they are what you
really want.

The scemas presented below are what cadent expects in it's tables, so one will at least need to match them in some form
For MySQL, for instance, if you wanted to do TTLs on data, you would need to partition the table to allow for easy
dropping of data at the proper time (and thus some of your indexes may change).  Cassandra is a bit more tricky as the
query patterns expect some element of consitency in the Primary key, but you may want different replication,
drivers, and other options that make your environment happy.



## Status

Not everything is "done" .. as there are many things to write and verify, this is the status of the pieces.

| Driver   | IndexSupport  |  TagSupport |  SeriesSupport | LineSupport  | TriggerSupport |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| cassandra | write+read  | No  | write+read | write+read | Yes |
| mysql  | write+read  | write+read  | write+read  | write+read  | Yes |
| kafka  |  write | write | write  | write  | n/a |
| elasticsearch |  read+write | read+write | No | read+write | No |
| whisper|  read | n/a | n/a  | write+read |  n/a |
| leveldb |  write+read | No | No  | No |  n/a |
| file |  n/a | n/a | n/a  | write |  n/a |



`IndexSupport` means that we can use this driver to index the metric space.

`TagSupport` means the driver will be able to index tags and read them (write/read).

`SeriesSupport` means the driver can support the TimeSeries binary blobs.

`LineSupport` means the driver can write and/or read the raw last/sum set from the Database backend.

`TriggerSupport` is the rollup of lower resolution times are done once a series is written.

`n/a` implies it will not be done, or the backend just does not support it.

`No` means it probably can be done, just not complete.


### Below are the "driver" names to use in configs for each backing DB (if they exist)

| DataBase   |  IndexName | LineName | SeriesName | TriggerName | LogSeriesName |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| cassandra | cassandra | cassandra-flat | cassandra | cassandra-triggered | cassandra-log{-triggered} |
| mysql  | mysql | mysql-flat | mysql | mysql-triggered |  |
| kafka  | kafka | kafka-flat | kafka |  |  |
| elasticsearch | elasticsearch | elasticsearch-flat |  |  |  |
| whisper |  whisper | whisper | | | |
| leveldb | leveldb | | | | |
| file |  | file | | | |



## When to choose and why

The main writers are

    - cassandra: a binary blob of timeseries points between a time range

        Good for the highest throughput and data effiency for storage.

    - cassandra-triggered: a binary blob of timeseries points between a time range

       Same as `cassandra` but uses triggering for rollups (see below)

    - cassandra-log: a binary blob of timeseries points between a time range put with a periodic "log"

           Same as `cassandra` for series, but uses a log (see #Log below)

    - cassandra-log-triggered: same as `cassandra-triggered`, but using the log technique as well

    - cassandra-flat: a row for each time/point

        Good for simplicity, and when you are starting out w/ cassandra to verify things are working as planned
        But, not exactly space efficient nor read/api performant.  But may be usefull (as it was for me)
        in verifification of the internals. As well as if you are going to have "out-of-order" time series.

    - whisper: standard graphite format

        Good for local testing or even a local collector for a given node, or if you simply want a better/faster/stronger
        carbon-cache like entity.

    - mysql: a binary blob of timeseries points between a time range

        If your data storage requirements are not overly huge, this is pretty good. (also since the local dev
        on cassandra is "hard" and slow as it was never meant to run in a docker container really, this is
        a bit easier to get going and start playing w/ blob formats)

    - mysql-triggered: a binary blob of timeseries points between a time range

        Same as `mysql` but uses triggering for rollups (see below)

    - mysql-flat:

        Like cassandra-flat but for mysql ..
        Good for "slow" stats (not huge throughput or volume as you will kill the DB)

    - kafka + kafka-flat:

        Toss stats into a kafka topic (no readers/render api for this mode) for processing by some other entity

    - elasticsearch-flat:

       For indexing, this is a good option especially if your cardinality of keys/tags is very high (where things
       benifit from a standard "text" indexer and not a scan of lists).

       ElasticSearch is not really efficient for huge volumes of time series data (unless you have a monster
       cluster).  MySQL acctually performs better for that, however it is, of course, not horizonally scaleable like ES.


Some basic performance things:

Cassandra is by far the best option for large metric volumes.
MySQL is good for local developement or relatively small volumes of metrics.
ElasticSearch is good for indexing, and though it does have built in "aggrigation" query forms, it does not
handle huge inputs effectively unless your cluster if very large.

If storage space is a concern, you should use the "series" writers, but you risk lossing data on the event of a crash (i.e.
data that is stillin ram and not yet written)


## Indexing


This is probably the most tricky part to get "correct".  There are many possible ways to do this, but we need to rememeber
we have a few fundemental things we want to be able to do.

For more info on how things are passed around [see the uniqueid doc](./uniqueid.md).


### Metric Path

The first is to behave and act like good-old-graphite, where there are not "tags" and just "metric paths" of the form

    my.metric.is.fun

To query these we can simply split the paths by the `.` and index things accordingly.  Since the original graphite
pattern is basically to do file system globs, finding something like

    `my.m*.{is,are}.*`

can easily map to a file system glob, or a nice text based index file and a brute force regex can be done.

The trouble is that this is a very "local" experience, the index live on just the machine in question.  We would like some
redendency in the mix, so we need to port this behavior to various other Database systems.  We end up doing something like
an inverted index, which is an expensive operation to compute.

We take the metric path, break it up into each set and insert

    my.metric.is.fun ->
        segment=my hasdata=false base=my.metric.is.fun baselen=4
        segment=my.metric hasdata=false base=my.metric.is.fun baselen=4
        segment=my.metric.is hasdata=false base=my.metric.is.fun baselen=4
        segment=my.metric.is.fun hasdata=true base=my.metric.is.fun baselen=4

Now we can easily query the database for `my.m*.{is,are}.*` by doing

    foreach row in (select * from table where baselen=4 and segment="my"):
         if regex.Match(row.base):
             return row.base


## Tags

Tags add yet another layer to things.  Where we now can crawl the metric path tree, tags are effectively filtering
metric paths, and since we don't know the combo of tags before hand, this can lead to some large space scans

    my.metric.path{unit=jiff,instance=r3.xl} -> pretty narrow unless you have alot of r3.xls each with hundered of this metric
    my.metric.path{host=abc,unit=jiff} --> pretty narrow as we have the host, and a unit
    my.metric.path{host=abc} --> also pretty narrow (unless this is kafka and there will litteraly be 10000 of these per host)
    my.metric.path{type=cpu} --> can be HUGE, all cpu metrics for the materics key

Thus the issue becomes one of being able to effecitvely query all the metrics that may be in a tags subset (we can easily
be in the many thousands, which for alerting/graphing/just looking so down right silly.  But we still need some cross reference
tables that map `metric path -> tag`.  This cross reference table can be huge.

If in a Mysql world, then there will be a row for every tag, path combo.  In Cassandra we can take advantage of the
"list" type which is then `path -> <list>(tags)` and query that by `where <tag> in <list>`.

We also need to maintain a `tag name` index (so we can find what our tags acctually are), and a `tag name -> value` index.

Finally each metric has a "uniqueId" that is a hash of the `path + tags` so the real mapping of the unique number of metrics
is much bigger then just the simple "path" method.  If you have 1 million "path"s (in the old graphite world), and
start to add tags to them, you have effectively exponentially increased the number of unique metrics in the system by tag
permutations.

So what have we learned from this ::

    - If using tags, keep the `metric path` unique counts down to a nice small number
    - If not using tags, just keep on keepin' on


### Metrics2.0 + Carbon2

This is a "pure" tag format, there is no "key".  The closest thing to a "key" in this format is the "what" tag.
The metrics key is thus infered from the tag list.  So basically this is a sort of redundent indexing mechanism, but it
allows us to use the usual graphite like "finders" for metrics.


## Triggered Rollups

For the mysql and cassandra series wrtiers, there is an option to "trigger" rollups from the lowest resolution
rather then storing them in RAM.  Once the lowest resolution is "written" it will trigger a rollup event for the lower
resolution items which get written to the the DB.  This can slove 2 issues,

    - No need for resolution caches (which if your metrics space is large, can be alot) and just needed for the highest resoltuion.

    - Peristence delay: the Low resolutions can stay in ram for a long time before they are written.  This can be problematic if things crash/fail as
    those data points are never written.  With the triggered method, they are written once the highest resolution is written.

To enable this, simply use the writer drivers of

    cassandra-triggered or mysql-triggered or cassandra-log-triggered

to the `writer.metrics` options (it will be ignored for anything other then the mysql and cassandra blob writers)


## Log

Unlike the other "series" based wrtiers that use the Size in ram before writing, this is pure time based.

It also is more tollerent of failures, by writing a temporary log also in the Database.

Every "N" seconds (default 10s) it will write a log of the current past N seconds of metrics to the DB
for a given sequence in a big-old-blob of zstd compressed json data.

Each sequence is "Y" seconds long (default 10min).  Since crashing or restarting cadent that has
many many thousands of metrics in ram caches that are not written, on restart this will re-read the last sequence
of the N second snapshots, and re-fill the caches (which if there are alot of metrics this to can take some time).

Once a time Y chunk is finished it is pushed to the front of the chunk list, and also written to the DB.

After the chunk is written it then removes the sequence slice logs from the DB.  Thus if things crash, restart
It only needs to grab the last chunk of data it had.

There can be "X" sequences held in ram for query speed (default of 6, plus the current one is 7 total).

While much nicer towards failures, it also can use much more ram, and be a bit less efficent in terms
of space consumed by the series type (as they will be shorter typically then using straight byte sized limies).
Also since there can be more chunks to itterate over on queries, query speed will suffer a little bit.


#### Max time in Cache

This applies only to Series/Blob writers where we store interal caches for a bunch of points.

Since the default
behavior is to write the series only when it hits the `cache_byte_size` setting.  This can be problematic for series
that are very slow to update, and they will take a very long time to acctually persist to the DB system.  The setting

    max_time_in_cache

for the `writer.options` section lets you tune this value.  The default value is 1 hour (`max_time_in_cache=60m`)


### SubWriters

Currently there is support for "double writing" which simply means writing to 2 places at the same time (any more then
that and things can get abused at high volume).
Each writer gets it's own cache/queue/etc. Which means that the RAM requiements (and CPU) are doubled in the worst case
(it depends on the subwriter config of course).
This was mostly meant for writing to your long term storage, and publishing events to kafka.  Or as a migration path
for moving from one storage system to another.


### Shutdown

On shutdown (basically a SIGINT), since there can be lots of data still in the cache phase of things.  Cadent will attempt to Flush all the
data it has into the writers.  It this in "full blast" mode, which means it will simply write as fast as it can.  If
There are many thousands of metrics in RAM this can take some time (if you have multiple resolutions and/or in triggered
rollup mode things need to do these writes too so more time).   So expect loads on both the cadent host and the DB system
to suddenly go bonkers.  If you need to "stop" this action, you'll need a hard SIGKILL on the processes.

### Caches

The internal caches are the repos for all inflight data before it is written.  Some cache configurations are such that
writes only happen on an "overflow".  An overflow is when a meteric has reached some configurable "max size".  Any "series"
based writer uses this "overflow" meathod.  In this overflow meathod a "max time in cache" is also settable to force a write
for things that slow to get points added.

For Non-series writers, this overflow is set to "drop".  Drop means any NEW incoming points will not be added to the
write cache, we do this as w/o it there is a huge chance the ram requirements will OOM kill the process and more data
is then lost.

The API render pieces also need knowledge of these caches as in the "short" timescales (minuets-hours) most all data is
in ram.  So it also needs to know of the caches.  As a resul there is a config section just for caches for an accumulator section.
There can be many defined as if doing double writes (say to cassandra series format and whisper/kafka single stat emitters)
the caches mean different things as for series, we want it to do an overflow, where as in the single point we want to emit as
soon as possible.

Just a note the `kafka-flat` writer does not currently use a write back cache, as it's assumed to be able to handle the
incoming volume.  Obviously if your kafka cannot take the many hundreds of thousands of messages per second, i suggest the
series method is used.

## Writer Schemas

## MySQL

### MYSQL-Flat + Index

Slap stuff in a MySQL DB .. not recommended for huge throughput, but maybe useful for some stuff ..
You should make Schemas like so (`datetime(6)` is microsecond resolution, if you only have second resolution on the
`times` probably best to keep that as "normal" `datetime`).  The TTLs are not relevant here.  The `path_table` is
useful for key space lookups

        CREATE TABLE `{segment_table}` (
            `segment` varchar(255) NOT NULL DEFAULT '',
            `pos` int NOT NULL,
            PRIMARY KEY (`pos`, `segment`)
        );

        CREATE TABLE `{path_table}` (
            `id` BIGINT unsigned NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT,
            `segment` varchar(255) NOT NULL,
            `pos` int NOT NULL,
            `uid` varchar(50) NOT NULL,
            `path` varchar(255) NOT NULL DEFAULT '',
            `length` int NOT NULL,
            `has_data` bool DEFAULT 0,
            PRIMARY KEY (`id`),
            KEY `seg_pos` (`segment`, `pos`),
            KEY `uid` (`uid`),
            KEY `length` (`length`)
        );


    CREATE TABLE `{tag_table}` (
      `id` BIGINT unsigned NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT,
      `name` varchar(255) NOT NULL,
      `value` varchar(255) NOT NULL,
      `is_meta` tinyint(1) NOT NULL DEFAULT 0,
      PRIMARY KEY (`id`),
      KEY `name` (`name`),
      UNIQUE KEY `uid` (`value`, `name`, `is_meta`)
    );

    CREATE TABLE `{tag_table}_xref` (
      `tag_id` BIGINT unsigned,
      `uid` varchar(50) NOT NULL,
      PRIMARY KEY (`tag_id`, `uid`)
    );


    CREATE TABLE {table}_{resolution}s (
          id bigint(20) unsigned NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT,
          uid varchar(50) CHARACTER SET ascii NOT NULL,
          path varchar(255) NOT NULL DEFAULT '',
          sum float NULL,
          min float NULL,
          max float NULL,
          last float NULL,
          count float NULL,
          time datetime(6) NOT NULL,
          PRIMARY KEY (id),
          KEY uid (uid),
          KEY time (time)
        ) ENGINE=InnoDB DEFAULT CHARSET=utf8;

If your for times are `times = ["10s", "1m", "10m"]` you should make 3 tables named

    {tablebase}_10s
    {tablebase}_60s
    {tablebase}_600s

And only ONE path/tag tables

    {path_table}, {tag_table}, and {tag_table_xref}

        periodic_flush= "1s" # regardless if batch_count met, always flush things at this interval (default 1s)


### MYSQL - blob

The index table the same if using mysql for that.  The Blob table is different of course.  Unlike the flat writer
which may have to contend with many thousands of writes/sec, this one does not have a write cache buffer as writes
should be much "less".  There will be times of course when many series need to be written and hit their byte limit
If this becomes an issue while testing, the write-queue mechanism will be re-instated.

    CREATE TABLE `{table}_{resolution}s` (
      `id` bigint(20) unsigned NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT,
      `uid` varchar(50) DEFAULT CHARACTER SET ascii NOT NULL,
      `path` varchar(255) NOT NULL DEFAULT '',
      `ptype` tinyint(4) NOT NULL,
      `points` blob,
      `stime` bigint(20) unsigned NOT NULL,
      `etime` bigint(20) unsigned NOT NULL,
      PRIMARY KEY (`id`),
      KEY `uid` (`uid`, `etime`),
      KEY `path` (`path`)
    ) ENGINE=InnoDB;


The acctual "get" query is `select point_type, points where uid={uiqueid} and etime >= {starttime} and etime <= {endtime}`.
So the index of (uid, etime) is proper.

## File

Good for just testing stuff or, well, other random inputs not yet supported
This will dump a TAB delimited file per `times` item of

    statname uniqueid sum min max last count resolution nano_timestamp nano_ttl

If your for times are `times = ["10s", "1m", "10m"]` you will get 3 files of the names.

## Cassandra

NOTE: there are 2 cassandra "modes" .. Flat and Blob

Flat: store every "time, min, max, sun, count, last" in a single row
Blob: store a "chunk" of a byte size (16kb default) in a bit packed compressed blob (a "TimeSeries")

Regardless of choice ...

This is probably the best one for massive stat volume. It expects the schema like the MySQL version,
and you should certainly use 2.2 versions of cassandra.  Unlike the others, due to Cassandra's type goodness
there is no need to make "tables per timer".  Expiration of data is up to you to define in your global TTLs for the schemas.
This is modeled after the `Cyanite` (http://cyanite.io/) schema as the rest of the graphite API can probably be
used using the helper tools that ecosystem provides.  (https://github.com/pyr/cyanite/blob/master/doc/schema.cql).
There is one large difference between this and Cyanite, the metrics point contains the "count" which is different
then Cyanite as they group their metrics by "path + resolution + precision", i think this is due to the fact they
dont' assume a consistent hashing frontend (and so multiple servers can insert the same metric for the same time frame
but the one with the "most" counts wins in aggregation) .. but then my Clojure skills = 0.
For consistent hashing of keys, this should not happen.


Please note for now the system assumes there is a `.` naming for metrics names

    my.metric.is.fun


You should wield some Cassandra knowledge to change the on the `metric.metric` table based on your needs
The below causes most compaction activity to occur at 10m (min_threshold * base_time_seconds)
and 2h (`max_sstable_age_days` * `SecondsPerDay`) windows.
If you want to allow 24h windows, simply raise `max_sstable_age_days` to ‘1.0’.

    compaction = {
        'class': 'DateTieredCompactionStrategy',
        'min_threshold': '12',
        'max_threshold': '32',
        'max_sstable_age_days': '1',
        'base_time_seconds': '50'
    }

### Cassandra Flat Schema

    CREATE KEYSPACE metric WITH replication = {'class': 'SimpleStrategy', 'replication_factor': '3'}  AND durable_writes = true;

    USE metric;

    CREATE TYPE metric_point (
            max double,
            min double,
            sum double,
            last double,
            count int
        );


        CREATE TYPE metric_id_res (
            id varchar,
            res int
        );

        CREATE TABLE metric.metric (
            mid frozen<metric_id_res>,
            time bigint,
            point frozen<metric_point>,
            PRIMARY KEY (id, time)
        ) WITH COMPACT STORAGE
            AND CLUSTERING ORDER BY (mpath ASC, time ASC)
            AND compaction = {
                'class': 'DateTieredCompactionStrategy',
                'min_threshold': '12',
                'max_threshold': '32',
                'max_sstable_age_days': '0.083',
                'base_time_seconds': '50'
            }
            AND compression = {'sstable_compression': 'org.apache.cassandra.io.compress.LZ4Compressor'};

        CREATE TYPE metric.segment_pos (
            pos int,
            segment text
        );


        CREATE TABLE metric.path (
            segment frozen<segment_pos>,
            length int,
            path text,
            id varchar,
            has_data boolean,
            PRIMARY KEY (segment, length, path, id)
        ) WITH compaction = {'class': 'org.apache.cassandra.db.compaction.SizeTieredCompactionStrategy'}
            AND compression = {'sstable_compression': 'org.apache.cassandra.io.compress.LZ4Compressor'};

        CREATE INDEX ON metric.path (id);

        CREATE TABLE metric.segment (
            pos int,
            segment text,
            PRIMARY KEY (pos, segment)
        ) WITH COMPACT STORAGE
            AND CLUSTERING ORDER BY (segment ASC)
            AND compaction = {'class': 'org.apache.cassandra.db.compaction.SizeTieredCompactionStrategy'}
            AND compression = {'sstable_compression': 'org.apache.cassandra.io.compress.LZ4Compressor'};

### Blob Schema

Much the same, but instead we store the bytes blob of the series.  `ptype` is the encoding of the blob itself.
Since different resolutions in cassandra are stored in one super table, we need to disinguish the id+resolution
 as a unique id.

        CREATE TABLE metric.metric (
            mid frozen<metric_id_res>,
            etime bigint,
            stime bigint,
            ptype int,
            points blob,
            PRIMARY KEY (mid, etime)
        ) WITH CLUSTERING ORDER BY etime ASC
            AND compaction = {
                'class': 'DateTieredCompactionStrategy',
                'min_threshold': '12',
                'max_threshold': '32',
                'max_sstable_age_days': '0.083',
                'base_time_seconds': '50',
                'tombstone_threshold': 0.05
            }
            AND compression = {'sstable_compression': 'org.apache.cassandra.io.compress.LZ4Compressor'};


### NOTE: for Cassandra 3

There's a better compaction method for the metrics that have pretty much constant time inputs (i.e. server metrics)
so i recommend doing below.


        CREATE TABLE metric.metric (
            mid frozen<metric_id_res>,
            etime bigint,
            stime bigint,
            ptype int,
            points blob,
            PRIMARY KEY (mid, etime)
        ) WITH CLUSTERING ORDER BY etime ASC
        AND compaction = {
            'class': 'TimeWindowCompactionStrategy',
            'compaction_window_unit': 'DAYS',
            'timestamp_resolution': 'SECONDS',
            'compaction_window_size': '1',
            'tombstone_threshold': 0.05
        }
        AND compression = {'sstable_compression': 'org.apache.cassandra.io.compress.LZ4Compressor'}
        AND read_repair_chance = 0,
        AND dclocal_read_repair_chance = 0;


     -- Or for single metric items


       CREATE TABLE metric.metric (
           mid frozen<metric_id_res>,
           time bigint,
           point frozen<metric_point>,
           PRIMARY KEY (id, time)
       ) WITH COMPACT STORAGE
           AND CLUSTERING ORDER BY (mid ASC, time ASC)
           AND compaction = {
               'class': 'TimeWindowCompactionStrategy',
               'compaction_window_unit': 'DAYS',
               'timestamp_resolution': 'SECONDS',
               'compaction_window_size': '1',
                'tombstone_threshold': 0.05
           }
           AND compression = {'sstable_compression': 'org.apache.cassandra.io.compress.LZ4Compressor'},
           AND read_repair_chance = 0,
           AND dclocal_read_repair_chance = 0;


DO NOT use this if things will be inserted "out of order by time" data or have alot of sparse data.

So you may wish to change the `compaction_window_size` to suit your query/insert patterns. Also change the
`timestamp_resolution` to the acctuall resolution you need.  Keep in mind that Cadent assumes second resolution for
any queries, as that's what graphite does/did.

For instance a 3 DAY size w/ expireing TTLs of 90 DAYS is good.  Or a 1 DAY size w/ 30 DAYS and so on.


### Cassandra + Table Per Resolution

If in the Options for the writes you specify `table_per_resolution` then we adopt the same model that we do for MySQL.

Things expect a table names `{metric_table}_{resolution in seconds}s` for each resolution. Like so

    metric_1s
    metric_10s
    metric_60s
    etc

This is acctually a good way to handle cassandra effectively.  Since in a trigger rollup world, we must "delete and re-insert"
the row for the rollup rows (or in this case tables).  Those tables will have many tombstones and need more compaction,
but since their resolution is smaller there will much less data to rollup.  This also lets you use the
`TimeWindowCompactionStrategy` more effecively in Cassandra 3, in that you can specifiy `compaction_window_size` more
appropriate for your TTL on the data.  It also keeps the write/read volume for the "quick (highest resolution)" data
out of the picture for doing rollups (if using triggered rollups), thus making things more effcient there.

* Remember * You'll need to add these tables to cassandra itself for now.

The potential only issue is that you're not able to "change resolutions", but if this needs to happen, you're better
off "restarting" everything anyway as all the old data is going to be hard to query and match up.

    [myaccumulator.accumulator.writers.metrics.options]
    table_per_resolution=true

Remember you should add your tables to use the proper `compaction_window_size` you need.

* REMEMBER * to set the same option in the API section (otherwise it will look for the know what to look for)

        [myaccumulator.accumulator.api.metrics.options]
        table_per_resolution=true

The schema is different as well since we no longer need a "resolution" in the data point

        CREATE TABLE metric.metric_{resolution}s (
            id ascii,
            etime bigint,
            stime bigint,
            ptype int,
            points blob,
            PRIMARY KEY (mid, etime)
        ) WITH CLUSTERING ORDER BY etime ASC


### Cassandra + Gotcha's

Some notes from the field::

Write Speed:: Cassandra Protocol v3 (cassandra <= 2.1) is MUCH slower then Protocol v4 (cassandra 2.2 -> 3.X).

Given that we may to need to write ~100-200 THOUSANDs metric points in our flush window (typically 5s-10s)
if we cannot fully write all the stats in the flush window beteen flush times, the app will have to SKIP a flush write
in order to basically not die a horrible death of RAM consumption and deadlocks.

As a result .. don't use cassandra 2.1, use at least cassandra 2.2

The tickers for the flushes attempt to try to flush things on proper mod internals
The ticker will try to start on `time % duration == 0` this is not exact, but it usually hits within a few milliseconds of the correct mode.
i.e. a "timer" of "10s" should start on `14579895[0-9]0`

To further make Cassandra data points and timers align, FLUSH times should all be the Smallest timer and timers should be multiples of each other
(this is not a rule, but you really should do it if trying to imitate graphite whisper data), an example config below

    [graphite-cassandra]
    listen_server="graphite-proxy"
    default_backend="graphite-proxy"

    # accumulator and
    [graphite-cassandra.accumulator]
    backend = "graphite-gg-relay"
    input_format = "graphite"
    output_format = "graphite"

    # push out to writer aggregator collector and the backend every 10s
    # this should match the FIRST time in your times below, but is not totally nessesary
    accumulate_flush = "10s"

    # aggregate bin counts
    times = ["10s:168h", "1m:720h", "10m:21600h"]

    [graphite-cassandra.accumulator.writer.metrics]

## ElasticSearch

Probably makes the most sence for Indexing data efficently, however, the metrics can also be passed to this backend store

### Indexing

### Metrics - Flat


The `_id` for these entries is {uid}-{nanosecond-timestamp} of the incoming metric, so it is possible to overwrite
metrics here.

Also note, that instead of a write-back cache, we instead do Batch inserts.  The default is 1000 metrics per batch.
Given there can be many batches for "high" volumes you may wish to tweak the thread/queue size for elastic search
in the .yml config file, otherwise inserts can fail.  If some in a batch to fail to get inserted they will be re-added
to the batch queue to be attempted again.

    threadpool:
        bulk:
            queue_size: 5000


Below is the basic schema for the indexed metrics.  Please note that I would only use ES for metrics storage if
you have out-of-order incoming metrics per key and their relative volume is "small" (small is subjective, but
since the system may need to inject many thousands of metric points per second, performance matters).  The storage
format for ES is also not the most efficient and takes up alot of disk space for a relatively small volme of metrics.

## Whisper

Yep, we can even act like good old carbon-cache.py (not exactly, but close).  If you want to write some whisper files
that can be used choose the whisper writer driver.  Unlink the carbon-cache, here only "one set" of aggregate timers
is allowed (just the `times=[...]` field) for all the metrics written (i.e. there is no `storage-schema.cof` built in yet).
Also this module will attempt to "infer" the aggregation method based on the metric name (sum, mean, min, max) rather
then using `storage-aggregation.con` for now.

Aggregation "guesses"  (these aggregation method also apply to the column chosen in the Cassandra/Mysql drivers)

        endsin "mean":              "mean"
        endsin "avg":               "mean"
        endsin "average":           "mean"
        endsin "count":             "sum"
        startswith "stats.count":   "sum"
        endsin "errors":            "sum"
        endsin "error":             "sum"
        endsin "requests":          "sum"
        endsin "max":               "max"
        endsin "min":               "min"
        endsin "upper_\d+":         "max"
        endsin "upper":             "max"
        endsin "lower_\d+":         "min"
        endsin "lower":             "min"
        startswith "stats.gauge":   "last"
        endsin "gauge":             "last"
        endsin "std":               "mean"
        default:                    "mean"


An example config below


    [graphite-whisper]
    listen_server="graphite-proxy"
    default_backend="graphite-proxy"

     # accumulator and
     [graphite-whisper.accumulator]
        backend = "BLACKHOLE"
        input_format = "graphite"
        output_format = "graphite"

     # push out to writer aggregator collector and the backend every 10s
     # this should match the FIRST time in your times below
     accumulate_flush = "10s"

     # aggregate bin counts
     times = ["10s:168h", "1m:720h", "10m:21600h"]

     [graphite-whisper.accumulator.writer.metrics]
        driver="whisper"
     	dsn="/root/metrics/path"
     	xFilesFactor=0.3
     	write_workers=32
     	write_queue_length=102400

## KAFKA + Kafka-Flat

I mean why not.  There is no "reader" API available for this mode, as kafka it's not designed to be that.  But you can
shuffle your stats to the kafka bus if needed.  There are 2 message types "index" and "metrics".  They can be
put on the same topic or each in a different one, the choice is yours.  Below is the 2 messages JSON blobs.
You can set `write_index = false` if you want to NOT write the index message (as the metric message has the metric in it
already and consumers can deal with indexing)


        INDEX {
            id: uint64 FNVa,
            uid: base36(id),
    	    type: "index | delete-index",
    	    path: "my.metric.is.good",
    	    segments: ["my", "metric", "is", "good"],
    	    senttime: [int64 unix Nano second time stamp]
    	    tags: []Tag //[{name: xx, value: xx }, {name: xx, value: xx}]
            meta_tags: []Tag // [{name: xx, value: xx }, {name: xx, value: xx}]
    	}

The "Flat" format is

    	METRIC{
    	    single: {
    	        time: [int64 unix Nano second time stamp],
    	        metric: "my.metric.is.good",
    	        id: uint64 FNVa,
    	        uid: string // base 36 from the ID
    	        sum: float64,
    	        min: float64,
    	        max: float64,
    	        last: float64,
    	        count: int64,
    	        resolution: float64,
    	        ttl: int64
                tags: [ {name: xx, value: xx }, {name: xx, value: xx}]
                meta_tags:  [ {name: xx, value: xx }, {name: xx, value: xx}]
    	    }
    	}

The "Blob" format is

    	METRIC{
    	    series: {
    	        time: [int64 unix Nano second time stamp],
    	        metric: "my.metric.is.good",
    	        id: uint64 FNVa,
    	        uid: string // base 36 from the ID
    	        data: bytes,
    	        encoding: string // the series encoding gorilla, protobuf, etc
    	        resolution: float64,
    	        ttl: int64,
    	        tags:  [ {name: xx, value: xx }, {name: xx, value: xx} ...]
                meta_tags:  [ {name: xx, value: xx }, {name: xx, value: xx} ...]
            }
    	}

Encoding formats supported are "json", "protobuf" and "msgpack"

Where as the "flat" format is basically a stream of inciming accumulated values, the blob format is

Here are the configuration options

            [[to-kafka.accumulator.writer.caches]]
                    name="gorilla-kafak"
                    series_encoding="gorilla"
                    bytes_per_metric=1024
                    max_metrics=1024000

            [to-kafka.accumulator.writer.metrics]
            driver = "kafka" // or "kafka-flat"
            dsn = "pathtokafka:9092,pathtokafka2:9092"
            cache="gorilla-kafka" # number of metrics to aggrigate before we must drop
            [to-kafka.accumulator.writer.metrics.options]
        	    # some kafka options
        	    compress = "snappy|gzip|none" (default: none)
        	    max_retry = 10
        	    ack_type = "local" # (all = all replicas ack, default "local")
        	    flush_time = "1s" # flush produced messages ever tick (default "1s")
        	    tags = "host=host1,env=prod" # these are static for whatever process is running this
        	    index_topic = "cadent" # topic for index message (default: cadent)
                metric_topic = "cadent" # topic for data messages (default: cadent)
                encoding = "msgpack"  # can be "json" or "msgpack" or "protobuf"


        	[to-kafka..accumulator.writer.indexer]
            driver = "kafka"
            dsn = "pathtokafka:9092,pathtokafka2:9092"

        	    [to-kafka..accumulator.writer.indexer.options]
                write_index = false|true

If you want to bypass the entire "graphite" thing and go straight to a kafka dump, look to
`configs/statsd-kafka-config.toml` and `configs/statsd-kafka-pregre.toml` pair .. this is probably the most typical use
of a kafka writer backend.  One can easily do the same with straight graphite data (i.e. from `diamond` or similar).


Since ordering and time lag and all sorts of other things can mess w/ the works for things, it's still best to fire stats to
a consistent hash location, that properly routes and aggregates keys to times such that stats are emitted "once" at a given time
window.  In that way, ordering/time differences are avoided.  Basically  `statsd -> flush to consthasher -> route -> flush to kafka`



### Whisper

99% of the performance issue w/ Wisper files are the Disks.  Since we typically here have large space requirements
(in the TB range) and we are in the Cloud (AWS for us).  We need to use EBS drives which are really slow compared
to any SSDs in the mix.  So you MUST limit the `writes_per_second` allowed or you'll end up in IOWait death.  For a
1 Tb (3000 iops) generic EBS (gp2) drive empirically we find that we get ~1500 batch point writes per/second max
(that's using all the IOPs available, which if you think of each "write" as needing to read first then write that
makes some sense).  So we set the `writes_per_second=1200` to allow for readers to actually function a bit.


### Writers Cache/Ram

This one is a bit tricky to figure out exactly, and it highly dependent on the metric volume and shortest "tick" interval.
The cache ram needed depends on # metrics/keys and the write capacity.  The cache holds a `map[key][]points`.  Once
the writer determines which metric to flush to disk/DB we reclaim the RAM.

Just some empirical numbers to gauge things, but the metric you should "watch" about the ram consumed by the cache are
found in `stats.gauges.{statsd_prefix}.{hostname}.cacher.{bytes|metrics|points}`.

    Specs:
        Instance: c4.xlarge
        EBS drive: 1TB (3000 IOPS)
        Flush Window: 10s
        Keys Incoming: 140,000
        Writes/s: 1200(set) ~1000 (actual)
        CacheRam consumed: ~300-600MB
        # Points in Cache: ~1.3 Million

The process that runs the graphite writer then consumes ~1.2GB of ram in total.  Assuming the key space does not
increase (by "alot") the above is pretty much a steady state.

#### "Flat" writers

This is the easiest to figure out capacity in terms of ram.  Basically while things are being aggregated you will need
at least `N * (8*8 bytes + key/tag lengths)` (N metrics) As each metric+tag set is in Ram until it hits a flush window
For example.  If you have 10000 metrics, you will need roughly ~200Mb of ram, JUST for the aggregation phase
FOR EACH RESOLUTION.  So if you have 5s, 1m, 10m flush windows you will need ~600-700Mb.

Since the "flat" metrics are flushed to write-back buffers, each flush will endup copying that aggregation buffer into
another set of lists.  For each point that's flushed, and not written yet, double your ram requirements.  Depending
on the speed of the writers, this can get pretty large.  For slow writers this can add up, so keep that in mind.

For things like kafka/cassandra, where writes are very fast, these buffers will be much smaller.

#### "Blob" writers

The timeseries binary blobs are a bit harder to figure out in therms of their exact RAM requirements as some of them
have variable compression based on the in values themselves (the Gorilla/Gob series for instance).  Others like
Protobuf/Msgpack have pretty predictable sizes, but they too can use variable bit encodings for things so it's not
written in stone.  And unlike the flat writers, series are only writen when they fill their `maxBytes` setting.

But a "worse case" is easily derminined as:

`NumResolutions * MaxNumMetrics * 7*64 (7 64bit nums) * 255 (worst case metric name size)`

That said, the Blob writers will "write for real" when they hit their configured byte threashold. So for an 8kb threashold

`NumResolutions * MaxNumMetrics * 8kb * 255 (worst case metric name size) = TotalRam Consumed` plus the above RAM
needed for just keeping the current set of aggregates. (And of course there is overhead associated with everything so give at
least 25% on top of that).

The difference is that all that data is stored in RAM and the qurey engine knows not to even bother with the backend
storage for the data, so read queries for hot/recent data are very fast.

Random experimentation using the Gorrilla "wide" format (where it needs to store all 8 64 numbers), 120k metrics w/ 2 resolutions
at 8kb block size is about 3Gb-4Gb for everything.

For those in AWS.  The r3 series is your friend or a big c3/4 as CPU cycles to ingest all the incoming is also important.
